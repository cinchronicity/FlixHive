    <h3> Documentation</h3>
    Welcome to MyFlix API documentation!
    <br>
    The myFlix API is a RESTful web service built with Node.js and Express that provides users with access to
    information about various movies, directors, and genres. The server-side application allows users to register,
    manage their profiles, and curate a list of their favorite movies. The API supports CRUD operations, allowing users
    to create, read, update, and delete data.
    <h3> Key Features </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>

    <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
    This API is part of a full-stack JavaScript project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The
    backend is built with Node.js and Express, with data stored in a MongoDB database and modeled using Mongoose.

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    The myFlix API serves as the backend component of a comprehensive movie application. It is designed for movie
    enthusiasts who want quick and easy access to a wide range of movie-related information. This project
    demonstrates skills in building scalable RESTful APIs, managing databases, and implementing user authentication
    and data security.

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    Developers can use the provided endpoints to interact with the movie database, manage user accounts, and
    retrieve movie data. The API supports standard HTTP methods, making it easy to integrate into any client-side
    application.
